This SQL project is designed to create a comprehensive database for tracking turtles. The database is called "turtle_tracker" and is made up of several tables that store information about different aspects of turtles and their care.

The first table is "species", which contains information about various turtle species. This table includes columns for the species name, average weight, average size, and color. This information can be used to track the physical characteristics of different turtle species and to help caretakers create the best possible living conditions for each species.

The "food" table stores information about different types of food that turtles eat. This table includes columns for the food name and food inventory. The food inventory column can be used to track the availability of different types of food, which can help caretakers ensure that turtles are getting the right nutrition.

The "biome" table stores information about different types of biomes where turtles can be found. This table includes a column for the biome name. This information can be used to track the different types of habitats where turtles live and to help caretakers create the best possible living conditions for each type of habitat.

The "state" table contains information about different states where turtles can be found. This table includes columns for the state ID and state name. This information can be used to track the different states where turtles live and to help caretakers understand the geographic distribution of different turtle species.

The "diet" table stores information about the diet of different turtle species. This table includes columns for the diet ID, food amount, water amount, and food name. This information can be used to track the dietary needs of different turtle species and to help caretakers ensure that turtles are getting the right nutrition.

The "habitat" table stores information about different turtle habitats. This table includes columns for the habitat ID, habitat name, average temperature, average humidity, square footage, and biome name. This information can be used to track the different types of habitats where turtles live and to help caretakers create the best possible living conditions for each habitat.

The "caretaker" table stores information about the caretakers who work with turtles. This table includes columns for the caretaker ID, first name, last name, phone number, address, email, hire date, city, zip code, salary, shift start time, shift end time, and state ID. This information can be used to track the caretakers who work with turtles and to help ensure that turtles receive the best possible care.

The "turtle" table stores information about individual turtles. This table includes columns for the turtle ID, turtle name, adoption date, weight, size, gender, habitat ID, diet ID, and species name. This information can be used to track individual turtles and to help caretakers understand the needs of each turtle.

Finally, the "turtle_schedule" table is used to track the schedule of caretakers who work with turtles. This table includes columns for the caretaker ID, turtle ID, schedule start time, and schedule end time. This information can be used to ensure that turtles receive the appropriate care from caretakers and that caretakers are able to manage their schedules effectively.

Overall, this turtle tracking database is designed to help caretakers better understand the needs of individual turtles and to ensure that turtles receive the best possible care. By tracking information about turtle species, food, biomes, habitats, caretakers, and individual turtles, this database can help caretakers make more informed decisions about how to care for these fascinating and unique animals.
