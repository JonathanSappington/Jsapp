			<p>
				Below is my sitemap for the friends forever rescue website. 
				As per the received information, I have included a detailed outline of the companies website and associated web pages, cohesively connecting the different aspects of the website
				to enhance the user experience and to make navigation as simple as possible. 
				Starting with the home page, it will show visitors a sneak peek of the companies wide variety of animals; and their mission of helping animals get adopted. 
				The website will have a sign-up so users can get notified when new animals are brought in and kept up to date on current events and activities. 
				The about page will include the companies about us statement, 
				the contact information for the company, 
				and it will showcase the Forever Friends Rescue's dedicated staff and shine a bright light on their efforts to help animals in need.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The adoption part of the website is the most important to get right; clicking on the pet adoption link will take the user to an adoption checklist 
				explaining the many criteria and duties that they should be aware of before adopting an animal. 
				The adoption categories will contain sections showing the many animals in need of a loving home. 
				The bird, dog, cat, and other pets section will allow users to look at the animals up for adoption and read a short description about their journeys, 
				needs, and personalities. The design will ensure that users pick the best possible pet for them and know as much as they can before adopting a pet.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The blog portion will be filled with posts about the animals' lives and stories; coming from the community and the company. 
				Users will be able to view the latest news on the company, showcasing stories on people who help animals in need when they need it the most. 
				There will be an events page allowing users to get notifications when exciting new events are happening. 
				The success stories section will provide stories of animals in dire conditions finding their perfect owner.
				This section of the website will make up the blog section ensuring people can easily keep up to date with the latest Forever Friends Rescue news.
